<!-- 
  Explanation of Imports:
  - The HTML file does not have traditional imports like JavaScript files.
  - Instead, it includes meta tags and a root div where the React application will be rendered.
  
  Why itâ€™s implemented this way:
  - The meta tags provide essential information about the document, such as character encoding and viewport settings.
  - The title tag sets the title of the document, which is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.
  - The noscript tag provides a fallback message for users who have JavaScript disabled, ensuring they know that JavaScript is required.
  - The root div serves as the main container for the React application, allowing React to render its components inside this div.
