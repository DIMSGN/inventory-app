 * reportWebVitals Function
 * This function measures and reports web vitals performance metrics.
 * It uses the web-vitals library to measure metrics such as CLS, FID, FCP, LCP, and TTFB.
 * 
 * Web Vitals are a set of metrics that measure the performance and user experience of a web application.
 * These metrics help developers understand how their application performs in real-world scenarios.
 * 
 * @param {Function} onPerfEntry - A function to handle the performance entries.
 * This function will be called with the performance metrics as they are measured.

/**
 * Explanation of Imports:
 * - The web-vitals library is dynamically imported to measure web vitals performance metrics.
 *   This library provides functions to measure key performance metrics that are critical for understanding the user experience.
 * 
 * Why itâ€™s implemented this way:
 * - The reportWebVitals function is designed to measure and report web vitals performance metrics.
 *   These metrics provide insights into the performance and user experience of the web application.
 * - The function checks if the onPerfEntry parameter is a function before proceeding.
 *   This ensures that the provided parameter can handle the performance entries.
 * - The web-vitals library is dynamically imported to reduce the initial bundle size and only load the library when needed.
 *   This approach improves the initial load performance of the application.
 * - The getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, and getTTFB functions from the web-vitals library are used to measure specific performance metrics.
 *   Each function measures a different aspect of the web application's performance and user experience.
 * - Each metric function is called with the onPerfEntry parameter to report the measured metrics.
 *   This allows the application to handle the performance metrics as they are measured, either by logging them to the console or sending them to an analytics endpoint.
