/**
 * Explanation of Imports:
 * - axios: This module is used to make HTTP requests from the browser to the server.
 * 
 * Why itâ€™s implemented this way:
 * - The axios module is used to simplify making HTTP requests to the product API.
 * - The API_URL constant defines the base URL for the product API, making it easy to update the URL if needed.
 * - The productService object provides a set of methods to interact with the product API, encapsulating the API calls and making them reusable throughout the application.
 * - The getProducts method sends a GET request to fetch all products from the API.
 * - The addProduct method sends a POST request to add a new product to the API.
 * - The updateProduct method sends a PUT request to update an existing product in the API.
 * - The deleteProduct method sends a DELETE request to delete a product from the API.
 * - The productService object is exported to be used in other parts of the application, allowing for easy integration of product-related API calls.
