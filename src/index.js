/**
 * Explanation of Imports:
 * - React: This module is used to create React components and manage component state and lifecycle.
 * - ReactDOM: This module is used to render React components to the DOM.
 * - './index.css': This imports the global CSS styles for the application.
 * - App: This is the main component of the Inventory Management System application.
 * - reportWebVitals: This module is used to measure performance in the application.
 * 
 * Why itâ€™s implemented this way:
 * - The ReactDOM.createRoot method is used to create a root element for the React application.
 * - The root.render method is used to render the App component inside the root element.
 * - The App component is wrapped in React.StrictMode to highlight potential problems in the application.
 * - The reportWebVitals function is used to measure performance in the application and log the results to the console or send them to an analytics endpoint.
