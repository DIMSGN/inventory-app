/**
 * Explanation of Imports:
 * - mysql: This module provides a way to interact with MySQL databases in Node.js.
 *   It allows you to create connections, execute queries, and manage transactions.
 * 
 * Why itâ€™s implemented this way:
 * - The mysql.createConnection method is used to create a connection to the MySQL database with the specified configuration.
 * - The db.connect method is called to establish the connection. If the connection is successful, a success message is logged.
 *   If the connection fails, an error message is logged.
 * - The database connection object (db) is exported so that it can be used in other parts of the application to interact with the database.
