/**
 * Explanation of Imports:
 * - express: This module is used to create an Express application, which provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
 * - cors: This module is used to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), allowing the server to accept requests from different origins.
 * - productRoutes: This module contains the routes for handling product-related API endpoints.
 * - ruleRoutes: This module contains the routes for handling rule-related API endpoints.
 * 
 * Why itâ€™s implemented this way:
 * - The express() function is used to create an instance of the Express application.
 * - The cors() middleware is used to enable CORS, allowing the server to accept requests from different origins.
 * - The express.json() middleware is used to parse incoming JSON requests, making it easier to work with JSON data in the request body.
 * - The app.use() method is used to mount the product and rule routes on the /api/products and /api/rules paths, respectively.
 * - The app.listen() method is used to start the server and listen on the defined port, logging a message to the console when the server is running.
